            <h3>Conversation: Age Gaps in Relationships (April 18, 2025)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Context Notes</strong>: The conversation occurs after B told A the previous night that a 28-year-old father of two, Jack, asked her out. They discuss the age gap (21 vs. 28), Jack’s two children from different mothers, and B’s concerns about workplace and social dynamics (working with one baby mother, Molly, and knowing the other from school). The setting isn’t specified, but the tone is casual yet emotionally charged, escalating to mild anger. A is diplomatic, using humor (e.g., Eminem, Radiohead references, “Yeth”) and shifts topics (car shopping) to de-escalate. B is expressive, alternating between confidence, sarcasm, and frustration. Their cousin dynamic allows teasing and open disagreement, ending playfully.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: So, about that father of two from last night—his name’s Jack, he’s 28, got two kids. Which isn’t terrible, but for him to have two baby mamas? Eek. One kid’s a lot older, from his first marriage.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Brotha man’s 28. In all reality, he should find someone his own age and maturity. I don’t know the guy, so I’m not gonna make any judgments, but I’m a firm believer you can go three years up or three years down in a relationship.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: I believe I’m pretty mature to handle a 28-year-old. I just don’t wanna be a stepmother.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: That being said, “it’s your life, live it however you wanna, mari-ju-ana is everywhere, where was you brought up?”—drug ballad Eminem.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: 21 and 28 can be a huge deal if it’s the woman older than the dude, but other than that, I don’t have a problem. I’ve grown, but the problem is I work with one of his baby mamas and went to school with the other. So, I’m playing it safe, rarely acknowledging his texts. I fear it’s making it worse.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: I wasn’t trying to say you’re not mature. If anything, he’s the one who’s immature.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: Yeah, I know.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Talking to a lot of women in today’s age, I’ve noticed women prefer older men because they’ve learned how to communicate better with the last three crazy bitches. They’re like an experienced tradesman. Men at our age don’t really know how to communicate—I’m guilty of this myself—but give them some time and life experience, hell, better communicate your frustrations to them, and they’ll learn.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: A lot of older dudes been peeping at me, and it’s kinda freaking me out. I don’t wanna look too young.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Brooke, you don’t even look 21. You still look fairly young.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: Yeah, I guess, but it’s something that throws me off.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Like I said, I don’t wanna make opinions on the man, but you look fresh outta high school, and he’s searching for that… as a father of two.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: Fresh outta high school is crazy. That’s a stretch to compare to. I’d say I still look 20.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: I didn’t mean to offend you with it.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: No, you didn’t. I was just saying I still look 20, probably not 25, lmao. 18-year-old me and 21-year-old me look so different, thank God.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Just saying, I’d guess 18–20, but you know what I’m saying.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: Yeth. [Side note: “Yeth” replacing “yes” is a common bit/joke created by A years ago.]</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: At the end of the day, I’m not trying to change your mind on anything or patronize you. I just had an opinion on it.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: Dude, if I genuinely look like a child, that’s concerning with the dudes I’m pulling. It’d just be gossip talk. He’s just a strange man. He pretended he didn’t know what I did for work or how old I was.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: If you didn’t have a drink in your hand or a visible tattoo, you probably wouldn’t be approached by a good-minded older man.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: False. It happens a lot without any of those things.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Those guys would probably fuck a kid.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: Dude, I don’t look like a child!</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: That just came out, don’t dwell on it.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: In my head, he just wants to get closer with his ex-wife that I work with, ‘cause I work with Molly.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: You don’t find that odd?</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: It’s weird ‘cause she already talked to me about it. And now I feel more shitty and low-key set up.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Like, she told you it was cool or something?</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: She made it known she doesn’t care.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: If any of my boys’ exes try something, which has happened before, I make sure to shut that shit down A$AP, no Rocky.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: I don’t know, I don’t wanna ruin my friendships with the girls. If I go on a date with him, it’s probably gonna be on the low, and I’ma be straight-up and tell him I don’t want anything but this date.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Well, by the sounds of it, you don’t even want to go. So why go? And if you’re hiding it, that’s only gonna lead to cracks in the friendship, and that’s damn near fact.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: What they won’t know won’t hurt them.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: If you wanna go on the date with the suspected creep—[Radiohead]—then do it, but if it was me, I’d also be open and honest to my friends about it. They’re gonna find out eventually.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: We aren’t even close like that. They haven’t talked in two years.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: So why should it matter if you let her know? If you’re not that close, it’s a repeat thing.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: Because that’s random and weird.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Then one of the boys fuck another’s ex, we have the decency to tell ‘em first.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: It’s just gonna look like I want a reaction. If Molly and I were as close as Izzy and I, it would be a different story.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Like I said, it’s your life, and you’re gonna make your own decisions, and if something were to arise, you would learn from it. Go with your gut.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: I’m just saying, if I agreed to the date, I wouldn’t feel obligated to tell. They’re not family, nor are we super close.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Again, you only listed reasons that sound negative about him, so why go?</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: It’s not negative having two kids. It’s negative that I know both parents. It just makes the world a whole lot smaller in my eyes. That’s why I’m not wanting to go.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: I never said being a father was a negative. I have nothing but respect for him raising those kids. The negatives are: you know both mothers, you work with one of them, he’s seven years older than you. I’m exactly seven years older than my brother; he’s in 8th grade. And you think this is all a ploy to get back with his ex that you work with.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: My brother is seven years older than me, and we get along fine. He’s actually five years older than me.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: He’s older than your brother.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: That negative is irrelevant, but the baby mama issue is why it’s bad.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: I find the age thing to be a pretty big deal. Like I said, three-year gap, maybe four.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: Okay, he was seven when I was born. We are both capable of taking care of ourselves. Bro, you must have been looking at younger girls and shaming yourself, ‘cause anytime I mention an age gap bigger than five years, you make it seem bad.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Put the age into perspective. Let’s say he’s 21, you would be just now starting high school.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: We’re not living in the past.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: My older cousin AJ is seven years older than I am. I would never date one of his exes, as I know he wouldn’t with one of mine, because that’s gross. And in seven years, I’m not gonna be looking at younger women because it’s fucking gross.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: I don’t know who besides you thinks that.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Normal people should. My parents are five years apart; I’ve told them I think that’s too far. In reality, you guys are in different generations. Look, I’m not gonna keep doing this. The other day, you said it was patronizing and irritating you. I don’t wanna continue that; it’s not my intentions.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: I don’t know, every time we talk about this, you get in your own head about age gaps. You did the same when I was 18 with a guy two years younger. It’s weird you think like that, especially when we’re not children.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: I was mostly giving you shit at 18, although I disagreed with it because it’s illegal. I didn’t find you to be a bad person.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: Dude, it wasn’t illegal at all, actually.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Trust me, you’re wrong on that. California doesn’t have Romeo and Juliet laws, and even if we did, it wouldn’t matter because you were already a legal adult at the time of the relationship’s start. I just have a firm belief on age gaps. I grew up around so many I disagreed with; it’s led me to this conclusion.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: All this is making me think that you’ve found younger women attractive and not admitting it. I’ve never met someone in my life firm on this subject. I don’t give a fuck, bro. Nobody’s calling the cops on an 18-year-old with a 16-year-old, and they’re not gonna call the cops when I’m with a 27-year-old.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: I grew up without grandfathers, just men at various ages with my aunts and other family members as well. Like I said, my opinion is based off experiences from my life.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: I didn’t have grandfathers either, and I didn’t come to that conclusion.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Different experiences, I suppose.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: All I’m saying is you’re weird for saying that and almost manifesting it for yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: I disagree. I feel like this conversation is becoming angered; I don’t want that, so… when are you supposed to go look at that car?</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: Today.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Cool.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong>: Oooga booga.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>: Ski mask moment.</li>
                <li><strong>Context Notes</strong>: A uses humor (e.g., Radiohead’s “Creep,” “A$AP, no Rocky,” “ski mask moment”) and shifts topics (car shopping) to de-escalate tension, consistent with his diplomatic style. B’s tone ranges from confident (“I’m mature”) to sarcastic (“that’s a stretch”) to frustrated (“you’re weird”), reflecting her expressive nature. The conversation escalates when B challenges A’s firm stance on age gaps, citing past discussions (e.g., B’s relationship at 18). Their cousin dynamic allows teasing (“Yeth,” “oooga booga”) and open disagreement, ending playfully to diffuse anger.</li>

They’re not family, nor are we super close.\n- **A**: Again, you only listed reasons that sound negative about him, so why go?\n- **B**: It’s not negative having two kids. It’s negative that I know both parents. It just makes the world a whole lot smaller in my eyes. That’s why I’m not wanting to go.\n- **A**: I never said being a father was a negative. I have nothing but respect for him raising those kids. The negatives are: you know both mothers, you work with one of them, he’s seven years older than you. I’m exactly seven years older than my brother; he’s in 8th grade. And you think this is all a ploy to get back with his ex that you work with.\n- **B**: My brother is seven years older than me, and we get along fine. He’s actually five years older than me.\n- **A**: He’s older than your brother.\n- **B**: That negative is irrelevant, but the baby mama issue is why it’s bad.\n- **A**: I find the age thing to be a pretty big deal. Like I said, three-year gap, maybe four.\n- **B**: Okay, he was seven when I was born. We are both capable of taking care of ourselves. Bro, you must have been looking at younger girls and shaming yourself, ‘cause anytime I mention an age gap bigger than five years, you make it seem bad.\n- **A**: Put the age into perspective. Let’s say he’s 21, you would be just now starting high school.\n- **B**: We’re not living in the past.\n- **A**: My older cousin AJ is seven years older than I am. I would never date one of his exes, as I know he wouldn’t with one of mine, because that’s gross. And in seven years, I’m not gonna be looking at younger women because it’s fucking gross.\n- **B**: I don’t know who besides you thinks that.\n- **A**: Normal people should. My parents are five years apart; I’ve told them I think that’s too far. In reality, you guys are in different generations. Look, I’m not gonna keep doing this. The other day, you said it was patronizing and irritating you. I don’t wanna continue that; it’s not my intentions.\n- **B**: I don’t know, every time we talk about this, you get in your own head about age gaps. You did the same when I was 18 with a guy two years younger. It’s weird you think like that, especially when we’re not children.\n- **A**: I was mostly giving you shit at 18, although I disagreed with it because it’s illegal. I didn’t find you to be a bad person.\n- **B**: Dude, it wasn’t illegal at all, actually.\n- **A**: Trust me, you’re wrong on that. California doesn’t have Romeo and Juliet laws, and even if we did, it wouldn’t matter because you were already a legal adult at the time of the relationship’s start. I just have a firm belief on age gaps. I grew up around so many I disagreed with; it’s led me to this conclusion.\n- **B**: All this is making me think that you’ve found younger women attractive and not admitting it. I’ve never met someone in my life firm on this subject. I don’t give a fuck, bro. Nobody’s calling the cops on an 18-year-old with a 16-year-old, and they’re not gonna call the cops when I’m with a 27-year-old.\n- **A**: I grew up without grandfathers, just men at various ages with my aunts and other family members as well. Like I said, my opinion is based off experiences from my life.\n- **B**: I didn’t have grandfathers either, and I didn’t come to that conclusion.\n- **A**: Different experiences, I suppose.\n- **B**: All I’m saying is you’re weird for saying that and almost manifesting it for yourself.\n- **A**: I disagree. I feel like this conversation is becoming angered; I don’t want that, so… when are you supposed to go look at that car?\n- **B**: Today.\n- **A**: Cool.\n- **B**: Oooga booga.\n- **A**: Ski mask moment.\n- **Context Notes**: A uses humor (e.g., Radiohead’s “Creep,” “A$AP, no Rocky,” “ski mask moment”) and shifts topics (car shopping) to de-escalate tension, consistent with his diplomatic style. B’s tone ranges from confident (“I’m mature”) to sarcastic (“that’s a stretch”) to frustrated (“you’re weird”), reflecting her expressive nature. The conversation escalates when B challenges A’s firm stance on age gaps, citing past discussions (e.g., B’s relationship at 18). Their cousin dynamic allows teasing (“Yeth,” “oooga booga”) and open disagreement, ending playfully to diffuse anger.`;
